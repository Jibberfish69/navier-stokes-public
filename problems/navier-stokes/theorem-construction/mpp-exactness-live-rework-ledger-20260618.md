# MPP Exactness Live Rework Ledger 2026-06-18

## Scope

This ledger records live mathematical rework, not completion by audit surface.
It separates edited theorem/proof surfaces from preserved transcript, generated,
or audit residues.

## Pulling-Teeth Linear-Profile Failure

Bad form:

```math
\nabla u\sim U/r
```

Live replacement:

```math
\Delta_r u(t):=\sup_{x,y\in B_r(x_*)}|u(x,t)-u(y,t)|,
\qquad
\Delta_r u(t)\le 2r\sup_{B_r(x_*)}|\nabla u(\cdot,t)|.
```

Along the moving radius:

```math
\rho(t)=\lambda\sqrt{T_*-t},
\qquad
\Delta_{\rho(t)}u(t)
\le
2\rho(t)\sup_{B_{\rho(t)}(x_*)}|\nabla u(\cdot,t)|.
```

Downstream consequence: no live theorem may spend a profile law, typical slope,
or scalar velocity amplitude in place of oscillation, a gradient supremum, or a
named carrier theorem.

Edited/current live surfaces: `submission-bundle/navier-stokes-submission.tex`,
`submission-bundle/source-field-reader-appendix.tex`, and the exactness audit
notes that point to the live replacement rather than acting as replacement.

## Cutoff Source-Closure Failure

Bad form:

```math
|\mathcal C_N^{cut}|
\le
\frac12\mathcal N_N^{visc}
+\mathfrak b_\psi^{cut} E_N
```

This was not licensed by the definitions because `E_N` carries the cutoff
weight `\phi_t^2`, while the Young term from the commutator carries
`|\nabla\phi_t|^2`.

Exact replacement:

```math
\mathcal E_N^{cut,\nabla}(h,t;\psi)
:=
\sum_{k=0}^{N}\lambda_k
\int |\nabla\phi_t|^2|\delta_hU_k|^2\,dx,
```

```math
|\mathcal C_N^{cut}(h,t;\psi)|
\le
\frac12\mathcal N_{N,h,\psi}^{visc}(t)
+4\nu\,\mathcal E_N^{cut,\nabla}(h,t;\psi).
```

Frozen-net consequence:

```math
\mathcal N_{N,\rho,\psi}^{src,\varepsilon,cut}
\le
\frac12\mathcal N_{N,\rho,\psi}^{visc,\varepsilon}
+4\nu\,\mathcal E_{N,\rho,\psi}^{cut,\nabla,\varepsilon}.
```

Downstream consequence: the source route is now conditional on `FCC.C1a`, the
explicit input

```math
\mathcal E_{N,\rho,\psi}^{cut,\nabla,\varepsilon}\in L^1(I),
```

or on a separate domination theorem proving that input from packet data.
The coefficient `\mathfrak b_\psi^{cut}` remains only cutoff-derivative
coefficient control; it does not close the source channel.

Edited live surfaces include the cutoff commutator note, cutoff-channel
reduction, source-sufficient closure, source-ledger split, strain/cascade
sufficient reduction, pressure/source verification ledger, PCTP source
verification, ACT.KX and LCI downstream packages, class-membership bridge
ledger, periodic/terminal source summaries, `live-theorem-edge.yaml`,
`cm-convergence-atlas.yaml`, and the reader appendix.

## Exact Source Route After Rework

The exact source route is now:

```math
FPCR.C+FSCR.C+FCC.C1+FCC.C1a\Longrightarrow FCI.5f.
```

The strengthened source import is now read as:

```math
\operatorname{Hyp}(FFSRC.A)\Longrightarrow FCI.5f,
```

where `\operatorname{Hyp}(FFSRC.A)` includes the weighted cutoff-defect input.

## Second Consequence Pass

The downstream source route was rechecked after the cutoff-source correction.
The following live theorem surfaces were edited so they no longer spend a bare
`FFSRC.A=>FCI.5f` or the old three-channel source chain without the cutoff-defect
input:

- `live-theorem-edge.yaml`;
- `mpp-terminal-class-membership-six-burden-closure-note.md`;
- `mpp-act-kx-hidden-spending-audit-note.md`;
- `mpp-pctp-hard-five-burden-frontier-audit-note.md`;
- `mpp-scf-aact-elliptic-source-endpoint-branch-package.md`;
- `mpp-seven-item-paper-grade-closure-package.md`;
- source-pulse / local-source theorem notes that refer to the downstream source
  supplier only as `\operatorname{Hyp}(FFSRC.A)=>FCI.5f`.

The old decision-bearing chain

```math
FPCR.C+FSCR.C+FCC.C1\Longrightarrow FCI.5f
```

is now allowed only as an explicitly named old spend being rejected.  The live
consumer-facing source theorem is either the exact branch with `FCC.C1a`, or the
strengthened source import with `\operatorname{Hyp}(FFSRC.A)`.

The Door 1 projected-stress note also contained a loose comparison statement.
It no longer says that the stress/native-carrier gap is merely "same order" as
the source wall.  The live statement is the defect

```math
\mathcal D_N^{PLP}
:=
\sum_{P\in\mathcal F_N}\int_{Q(P)}
\mathcal N_{preCauchy}^{loc}(u;P)\,dxdt
+
\int T:\nabla(\chi_R\ell)\,dy,
```

and the required unproved bound

```math
|\mathcal D_N^{PLP}|\le \mathrm{Legal}_N+o_N(1).
```

Until that defect inequality is proved on the same selected terminal family, the
stress-flux projection cannot be spent as a lower bound for the native positive
source wall.

`middle-band-flux-gap-kernel-theorem.md` was also tightened from "pointwise scale
estimate" to "pointwise kernel bound"; the displayed inequality was already the
exact object, and the edit prevents it from being read as scale intuition.

## Proof-Verb Inclusion And Finite-Measure Rework

Old loose steps:

- `mpp-packet-collar-next-rung-control.md` proved `PC.A` by saying it was
  "Immediate from `(PC.2)`--`(PC.7)`."
- `uniform-packet-bounds-collapse-small-radius-budget.md` proved `UPB.C` by
  saying it was "Immediate from `(UPB.9)` and `(UPB.10)`."
- Downstream summaries said the radius-gap route "gives" a uniform
  shrinking-radius theorem without naming the finite-measure calculation.

Exact replacements:

For `PC.A`, the live proof now shows the containments. If
\(\eta\in\mathcal R_{\rho}^{ref}(t;\psi)\), then `(PC.2)` gives
\(|\eta|\le\Lambda_{\rho,\psi}^{ref}(I)\), hence
\(\eta\in\mathbb B_{\rho,\psi}^{ref}(I)\) by `(PC.3)`, so
\[
X(a,t)+\eta\in\mathfrak B_{\rho,\psi}(t;I).
\]
Then `(PC.6)` puts both \(\mathfrak B_{\rho,\psi}(t;I)\) and
\(\mathfrak S_{\rho,\psi}(t)\) in \(\mathfrak P_{\rho,\psi}(t)\), and
`(PC.7)` puts every distance-zero point of \(\mathfrak P_{\rho,\psi}(t)\) into
the collar \(\mathcal C_{\rho,\psi}^{\delta}(t)\). This proves `(PC.10)`
without a hidden geometry shortcut.

For `UPB.C`, the live proof now spends the exact pointwise and measure
calculation:

```math
r_J(z)^2\le\rho_J^2,
\qquad
\int_I\int_{\mathcal J}r_J(z)^2\,d\mu_J^{pair}\,dt
\le
\rho_J^2\mu_J^{pair}(\mathcal J\times I)
\le
\mathfrak m_\ast\rho_J^2=o_J(1).
```

Downstream consequence: the stronger compact-support/localizer route is
conditional on the fixed gap floor, finite active measure, and uniform
shrinking-radius bound \(r_J\le\rho_J\to0\). It is still a bypass realization,
not the installed minimal overlap theorem wall. The packet-collar route still
has the open `PC.D` / collar Sobolev / interval-propagation burdens; the
geometric containment step itself is no longer an unresolved proof verb.

- `theorem-construction/localized-projector-localizer-modulus-overlap-reduction.md`;
- `theorem-construction/compact-support-localizer-shrinking-radius-implies-center-spacing.md`.

Residuals: the remaining "Immediate from" hits found in this batch are inside
`mpp-exactness-residue-audit-classification-20260617.json`, a generated audit
residue, not a live theorem/manuscript surface.

## Compactness Scale-Estimate Rework

Old loose step:

- `submission-bundle/sections/rebuilt-compactness-exact-object-branch.tex`
  introduced the compactness branch by saying "Energy, enstrophy, and scale
  estimates follow the original Navier--Stokes branch."
- `submission-bundle/proof-attempt-failure-appendix.tex` mirrored the same
  loose payment by saying "The scale estimate feeds the energy/enstrophy
  bridge."

Exact replacement:

The live manuscript now says compactness may spend only estimates already proved
for the original solution, for example

```math
\sup_{t<T_*}\|u(t)\|_{L^2}^2<\infty,
\qquad
\nu\int_0^{T_*}\|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^2\,dt<\infty.
```

For an \(H^s\) extraction along \(t_n\uparrow T_*\), the high-frequency payment
is the exact spectral tail

```math
\operatorname{Tail}_s(N;\{t_n\})
:=
\sup_n\sum_{j>N}2^{2sj}\|P_j u(t_n)\|_{L^2}^2,
\qquad
\lim_{N\to\infty}\operatorname{Tail}_s(N;\{t_n\})=0.
```

The failure appendix now names the first four-body arrow as a required
scale-barrier inequality \(S_{\mathrm{cl}}\to Q_{\mathrm{cl}}\); without that
inequality, scale language does not feed the energy/enstrophy bridge.

Downstream consequence: compactness remains a receiver of already-proved tail,
source, participation, and exact-object controls. It cannot create the scale or
tail payment and cannot turn a weak terminal object into an \(H^s\) endpoint
record unless the displayed tail limit is proved on the selected sequence.

## Kernelized Lifted-Band Scale-Separation Rework

Old loose step:

- `submission-bundle/sections/rebuilt-kernelized-lifted-band-branch.tex` said
  that when \(k\) is separated from \(j\), "the interaction kernel should carry a
  factor that shrinks as \(j-k\) grows."
- The derivative-bill paragraph described the arithmetic as happening "in the
  separated model."

Exact replacement:

The live section now states that the proof burden is the separated-band
inequality itself:

```math
\big|\langle P_j((P_k u\cdot\nabla)u^{\mathrm{near}}_j),u_j\rangle\big|
\le C_{\alpha}2^{-\alpha(j-k)} A_{j,k}(t),
\qquad k<j-C.
```

The section now says scale separation by itself is not a payment.  The remaining
question is whether a proved decay factor \(2^{-\alpha(j-k)}\), with constants
uniform in \(j,k\), is strong enough to make the lower-prefix sum legal.  The
derivative-bill paragraph now describes the obstruction as dyadic bookkeeping for
the displayed kernel gain:

```math
2^{-(j-k)}\cdot 2^j=2^k.
```

Downstream consequence: this branch no longer spends frequency-separation
intuition or a model profile as proof force.  It remains open until the
separated-band estimate above is proved with the stated uniformity and with an
admissible \(A_{j,k}(t)\) that makes the \(k<j-C\) summation legal.

## Edited Or Preserved Residues

Edited: live theorem/proof/manuscript surfaces whose route statements or
estimates depended on the exactness failures above.

Intentionally preserved: source transcripts, sample PDFs, generated MCP notes,
older paper-arc production packets, quarantine ledgers, and audit JSON/MD files.
Those surfaces may preserve old language as evidence or historical output, but
they are not proof authority and are not allowed to discharge a live theorem.

Still mathematically open: prove `FCC.C1a` directly or prove a domination theorem
that derives the weighted cutoff-defect integrability from already-admitted
packet/collar data.
